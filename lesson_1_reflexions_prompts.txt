1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Using diff command helped me to find the bug by showing to me the exact differences bewtween the old
and the new file.

2.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient
programmer in the long term?

I can see how the file evolved and when I have a problem I can revert back to a working version.

3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: only significant changes will be saved
Cons: you can forget cu commit and the change to be too big.

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because one change in one file could affect the other files too.

5.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log and name of the file
git diff and the name of the two commits to see the differencs between them.

6.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Knowing I can revert back any time I want will make me more confident.

7.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to try git for my android development course.
