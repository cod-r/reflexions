1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new hidden folder named .git is created.
To have a history of my project changes.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?

It is different because it only contains the files you want, not all the files.
It lets you pick what files you want to commit at once.
