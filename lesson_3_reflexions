1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locd

When I am working on a project with other people

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might want to go a different path with the project, or maybe I am working on a new feature and I dont want the other people that are working on the project to make changes that are breaking things up for me.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I will use forks when I want to clone a repository to my own github account.
I will use clone when I want to clone an entire repository to my computer.
I will use branches when I will make changhes that are experimental and I will not want to break things in master branch.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

That way I have the latest code of the project and I can work offline.
